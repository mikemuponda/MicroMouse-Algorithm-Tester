# MicroMouse-Algorithm-Tester
This is a continuation of the Micromouse project, but uses a CLI to simulate the operation.

# To Use The File
As of now (2018.5.28), just compile the gui_tester.c, gui.c, gui.h, and micromouse_structs.h files. 


# Future Plans
- Wall Builder: Be able to create your own map with predefined wall values to see if the Micromouse could solve said map
- Steps: Count the number of steps the Micromouse has taken
- Parallel Distance Array/Wall Array
- Arduino Crossover: Moving the algorithms over to an Arduino Project
